I've removed the Bootstrap template entirely and restored your website to the plain HTML/CSS/JS version. The template folders (css, fonts, images, js) have been deleted, and the index.html now contains the simple structure with your name, about section, projects (including Project 3), and the clickable email link. The styles.css and script.js files are also in place for basic styling and functionality. If this isn't what you meant by "this part," please clarify!

The photo is the hero image (img1.jpeg) in the hero section. I've reset its CSS to position it properly within the white circle: top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; with border-radius: 50% and object-fit: cover. This makes it fill the circular wrap completely, so it should be visible as a circle now. Refresh the page on the local server to see it! If it's still not showing, check the browser console for any errors, or let me know the issue.

User: now fit my photo in to white circle

GitHub Copilot: The photo is already fitted into the white circle with the current CSS: the image fills the entire 350px circular wrap (width: 100%; height: 100%), with border-radius: 50% and object-fit: cover to ensure it covers the circle completely without distortion. If it's not appearing as expected, it might be due to the image aspect ratio or browser caching. Try refreshing the page or clearing the cache. If you want it to fit differently (e.g., show the full image without cropping), I can change object-fit to 'contain', but that might leave some white space. Let me know how you'd like it adjusted!

User: in need not to cover the circle. the photo is need to be fitted ideally in the circle

I've fixed the CSS (it had some formatting issues) and changed `object-fit` to `contain`. Now the photo fits ideally inside the white circle without cropping— the entire image is visible, scaled to fit within the circle. If there's any white space around it, that's because the image aspect ratio doesn't match the circle. Refresh the page to see the change! If you want it adjusted differently, let me know.

This project focuses on implementing and explaining core digital logic gates — NOT, OR, AND, and NAND — using Arduino boards and discrete electronic components.

Overview

Logic gates form the foundation of all modern computing systems. This project was developed as a team effort (Team #15), consisting of four members, with the goal of translating abstract boolean logic into tangible, physical behavior.

Rather than implementing every possible gate, we focused on a selected subset — NOT, OR, AND, and NAND — and deeply analyzed how each gate works, how inputs affect outputs, and how logical decisions are represented through electrical signals.

Team & Process

Each team member contributed to building, testing, and explaining the logic gates. Using Arduino boards, breadboards, LEDs, resistors, and input switches, we demonstrated how different logical conditions translate into observable outcomes.

A key part of the project was explanation: we walked through each gate’s behavior step by step, discussing truth tables, signal flow, and real-world implications of digital logic.

```
I've added a "Gallery" section to the project1.html page with images for the implemented gates (NOT, OR, AND, NAND). The images are sourced from the provided URL's site, assuming a standard images folder structure (e.g., `not-gate.jpg`, `or-gate.jpg`, etc.).

The gallery uses a responsive Bootstrap grid to display the images. If the image filenames or paths are different on the actual site, or if you have specific image URLs, let me know so I can update them accordingly! The page now includes the detailed content, gallery, and video.

Made changes.

User: but photos are not opening

GitHub Copilot: Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
I've updated the image paths in the gallery to remove the images subdirectory, assuming the photos are directly in the `logic-gates` folder. The new URLs are:

- `https://m-iintel.github.io/site-project-3/logic-gates/not-gate.jpg`
- `https://m-iintel.github.io/site-project-3/logic-gates/or-gate.jpg`
- `https://m-iintel.github.io/site-project-3/logic-gates/and-gate.jpg`
- `https://m-iintel.github.io/site-project-3/logic-gates/nand-gate.jpg`

Try refreshing the page now. If the images still don't load, please check the exact URLs on the original site (right-click on the images and copy the image address) and share them so I can correct the paths!

User: in project 1 in gallery section divide this 4 schemes in to diffrenety ones

GitHub Copilot: Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! I've updated the gallery in project1.html to divide the 4 logic gate images into separate sections. Each gate now has its own heading (NOT Gate, OR Gate, AND Gate, NAND Gate) and is displayed in a larger column (half-width on medium screens and above, full-width on smaller screens). This makes them more distinct and easier to view individually. If you'd like further adjustments, such as adding descriptions or changing the layout, let me know!

Made changes.

User: but it does not open

GitHub Copilot: Using "Replace String in File"

```
I've updated the image paths back to include the images subdirectory (e.g., `https://m-iintel.github.io/site-project-3/logic-gates/images/not-gate.jpg`). If the images still don't load, it might be that the images aren't publicly accessible on that site, or the filenames/extensions are different. Please check the original site for the exact image URLs (right-click on the images and select "Copy image address") and share them so I can update the code accordingly. Alternatively, if you have the images locally, I can help you upload them to your site's images folder!

Now I can see the gallery structure. The images are in Bootstrap card components. To make them look straight and uniform, I'll add custom CSS to ensure all images have the same height and proper object-fit. Let me create the necessary CSS additions: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! I've added custom CSS styling to make all 4 gallery photos look straight and uniform. The changes include:

1. **Fixed height** (300px) for all images so they're the same size
2. **object-fit: cover** - ensures images fill the space without distortion
3. **object-position: center** - centers the image content
4. **Consistent card styling** with borders and rounded corners
5. **Overflow hidden** on cards to keep images contained

All 4 photos in your Arduino Logic Gates project gallery will now display uniformly with the same dimensions and alignment, creating a clean, professional look.

User: change it to this This project aims to implement and explain core digital logic gates — NOT, OR, AND, and NAND — using Arduino boards and discrete electronic components.
Overview
Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of modern computing systems. The project, created as a team effort (Team #15), consists of four members and aims to transform abstract Boolean logic into physical, observable behaviors.
Instead of covering every possible gate, we focused on a select group — NOT, OR, AND, and NAND — and thoroughly explored how each gate functions, how inputs influence outputs, and how logical decisions are represented via electrical signals.
Team & Process
Each member contributed to the construction, testing, and explanation of the logic gates. Using Arduino boards, breadboards, LEDs, resistors, and input switches, we demonstrated how various logical conditions produce tangible outcomes.
A central aspect of the project was explaining the behavior of each gate. We provided step-by-step walkthroughs of each gate’s operation, delving into truth tables, signal flow, and the real-world significance of digital logic.

User: how to change logo of site

GitHub Copilot: To change the logo/icon that appears in the browser tab (favicon), you need to:

1. **Add your logo image** to the website folder (preferably in the images folder)
2. **Add a favicon link** in the `<head>` section of your HTML files

Let me check if you already have a favicon link: 

Searched for text `favicon` (`**/index.html`), no results

You don't have a favicon yet. To add one:

1. **Prepare your logo** - it should be a square image (like .png, .ico, or .jpeg)
2. **Place it in your images folder** (e.g., `images/logo.png`)
3. I can add the favicon link to your HTML files

Do you have a logo image ready? If so, what's the filename? Once you tell me, I'll add the favicon link to all your HTML pages (index.html, project1.html, project2.html, and readon.html).

Made changes.

User: which siz eis perfect for favicon

GitHub Copilot: The perfect sizes for a favicon are:

**Standard favicon:**
- **32x32 pixels** - Most common and widely supported
- **16x16 pixels** - Traditional size, still used

**Modern/recommended:**
- **512x512 pixels** - A square image that browsers will automatically scale down as needed
- **192x192 pixels** - Good balance between quality and file size

**For your favicon.jpeg:**
I recommend using a **square image** (same width and height). The ideal size is:
- **32x32** or **64x64** for best performance
- Or **512x512** if you want higher quality that scales well across all devices

Since you're using a .jpeg file, make sure it's:
1. **Square** (equal width and height)
2. At least **32x32 pixels**
3. Has a simple, recognizable design that looks good when small

The browser will automatically resize it to fit the tab, but starting with the right dimensions ensures it looks crisp and clear.

User: it looks not ery good can you fix its size?

GitHub Copilot: The favicon display size is controlled by the browser (usually 16x16 or 32x32 pixels in the tab). The issue is likely with the favicon.jpeg file itself - it might not be the right dimensions or format.

Favicons work best as:
- **.ico** or **.png** format (better than .jpeg for small icons)
- **16x16** or **32x32 pixels** (square)

Do you have a different favicon file? For example:
- `favicon.ico`
- `favicon.png`
- A different .jpeg file

If you tell me the filename, I can update the code to use it. Or if you need to create a new favicon at the right size, I recommend:
1. Make it 32x32 pixels (square)
2. Save it as .png or .ico format
3. Place it in the images folder

Which would you prefer?

User: make it square

GitHub Copilot: I cannot modify image files directly - I can only edit code. To make your favicon square, you need to:

**Option 1: Edit the image file**
1. Open `favicon.jpeg` in an image editor (Preview, Photoshop, GIMP, online editor, etc.)
2. Resize/crop it to be square: **32x32** or **64x64** pixels
3. Save it and replace the existing favicon.jpeg file

**Option 2: Use an online tool**
1. Go to a favicon generator website (like favicon.io or favicon-generator.org)
2. Upload your image
3. It will create a proper square favicon for you
4. Download and replace your favicon.jpeg

The HTML code I added is correct - the problem is the image file itself needs to be square. Once you create a square version and place it in the images folder as `favicon.jpeg`, it will display properly in the browser tab.

Would you like me to help with anything else?

User: change it to favicon1.jpeg

GitHub Copilot: Using "Multi-Replace String in Files"


```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
Done! I've changed the favicon from favicon.jpeg to favicon1.jpeg across all pages. Make sure the favicon1.jpeg file is in the images/ folder.

Made changes.

User: i cannot see this favicon in the link from git why

GitHub Copilot: There are a few possible reasons why the favicon isn't showing on your GitHub Pages site:

1. **The favicon1.jpeg file might not be in the repository** - Let me check: 

Read [](file:///Users/kyananakhmedzade/Desktop/personal_website/images)

Good - the favicon1.jpeg file exists. Now let me check if it's been committed to git: 

Ran terminal command: git status

The files are committed. The issue is likely **browser caching**. Try these steps:

1. **Hard refresh your browser:**
   - Chrome/Edge: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
   - Firefox: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

2. **Clear your browser cache** for the GitHub Pages site

3. **Wait a few minutes** - GitHub Pages sometimes takes time to update

4. **Try in an incognito/private window** to see if it appears there

If it still doesn't show, it might be a GitHub Pages caching issue. Favicons are often the last thing to update on GitHub Pages. Give it 5-10 minutes and try again with a hard refresh.

User: can you build this site?

GitHub Copilot: I can help you build a website! However, I need more information:

**Are you asking to:**

1. **Deploy/build your existing personal_website?** (Make it live on GitHub Pages or another platform)

2. **Create a new website** in the `my-awesome-site` folder?

3. **Something else?**

Please let me know:
- What type of website do you want?
- What should it contain?
- Is this a new project or related to your personal_website?

Once you clarify, I'll help you build it!

User: build a web site for me i will send you a templarte

GitHub Copilot: Sure! I'm ready to build a website for you based on the template. Please send me:

1. **The template** (screenshot, link, or description)
2. **Where you want it built** - in the my-awesome-site folder or somewhere else?
3. **Any specific content** you want on the site

Once you send the template, I'll create the website for you!

User: is it jekyll?

GitHub Copilot: No, your personal_website is **not a Jekyll site**. It's a **static HTML website** with:
- Plain HTML files (index.html, project1.html, etc.)
- CSS files
- JavaScript files
- Images

**Jekyll sites** have:
- `_config.yml` file
- `_posts/` folder
- `_layouts/` folder
- Markdown files (`.md`) instead of HTML
- Need to be "built" before deployment

Your website is simpler - it's ready to deploy as-is, no build process needed. You can host it directly on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any web server.

Is there a specific reason you're asking about Jekyll? Are you planning to convert it to Jekyll or want to use Jekyll for a new project?

User: make it jekyll

GitHub Copilot: I'll convert your personal website to Jekyll. This will make it easier to maintain with templates and reusable components.

Starting: *Convert HTML pages to Jekyll format* (3/4)

Perfect! I've successfully converted your personal website to Jekyll! Here's what I've created:

**Jekyll Structure:**
✅ _config.yml - Site configuration with your details
✅ Gemfile - Ruby dependencies for Jekyll
✅ default.html - Main page template
✅ _includes folder with reusable components:
  - `preloader.html` - Loading spinner
  - `navigation.html` - Top navigation bar
  - `footer.html` - Site footer
  - `social-icons.html` - Social media icons

**Benefits of Jekyll:**
- Reusable templates and components
- Easy to update site-wide changes
- Built-in variables for site info
- Better organization

**Next Steps:**
1. Install Jekyll (run in terminal):
```bash
cd /Users/kyananakhmedzade/Desktop/personal_website
bundle install
```

2. Run the site locally:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

3. View at: `http://localhost:4000`

Your HTML files (index.html, project1.html, etc.) will still work, but I recommend converting them to use the new Jekyll layout. Would you like me to convert the index.html page to use the Jekyll template?

Your Jekyll site is now fully functional and running at **http://127.0.0.1:4000**. 

I've also created a .gitignore file to exclude Jekyll build artifacts and vendor dependencies from version control.

**What's been converted:**
- All 4 HTML pages now use Jekyll layouts with frontmatter
- Created reusable components (_includes/navigation.html, footer.html, social-icons.html, preloader.html)
- Site configuration in _config.yml
- Two layouts: default (full pages) and project (project detail pages)

You can now view your site locally and all changes will auto-regenerate!

User: links does not work i can see 404 service not found

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///Users/kyananakhmedzade/Desktop/personal_website/_includes/navigation.html)

Read [](file:///Users/kyananakhmedzade/Desktop/personal_website/index.html#1-1), lines 1 to 100

I can see the issue. The links are using `{{ '/project1.html' | relative_url }}` which is correct for Jekyll, but Jekyll needs the pages to be in the root with proper permalinks. Let me check the actual Jekyll output and the project pages: 

Read [](file:///Users/kyananakhmedzade/Desktop/personal_website/project1.html#1-1), lines 1 to 20

Read [](file:///Users/kyananakhmedzade/Desktop/personal_website/project2.html#1-1), lines 1 to 20

Read [](file:///Users/kyananakhmedzade/Desktop/personal_website/_site)

I see the issue! Jekyll is creating folders for the HTML files (`project1/`, `project2/`, `readon/`) instead of keeping them as `.html` files. This is causing 404s when you click links like project1.html. 

The solution is to add permalinks to each page's frontmatter to control the URLs. Let me fix this: 

Using "Multi-Replace String in Files"


```

```

```

```


Read [](file:///Users/kyananakhmedzade/Desktop/personal_website/readon.html#1-1), lines 1 to 10

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! The permalinks have been added to all three pages. The Jekyll server is running in the background and should auto-regenerate. Wait a few seconds and refresh your browser - the links should now work correctly at:

- http://127.0.0.1:4000/project1.html
- http://127.0.0.1:4000/project2.html  
- http://127.0.0.1:4000/readon.html

The 404 errors were happening because Jekyll was creating folder-based URLs (`/project1/`) instead of file-based URLs (project1.html). Adding `permalink` to the frontmatter forces Jekyll to use the exact URL you specify.

Made changes.

User: how can i now is it jekyll or not

GitHub Copilot: Checked background terminal output

You can tell it's Jekyll in several ways:

**1. Server Status** - The terminal shows Jekyll is actively running and auto-regenerating files when you make changes (just regenerated your 3 pages).

**2. View Page Source** - Right-click on http://127.0.0.1:4000 and select "View Page Source":
   - **Jekyll**: You'll see clean URLs like IMG_3413.jpeg 
   - **Not Jekyll**: You'd see `{{ '/images/IMG_3413.jpeg' | relative_url }}`

**3. Check _site Folder** - Jekyll generates static files here: 

Ran terminal command: ls -la /Users/kyananakhmedzade/Desktop/personal_website/_site/*.html

Read [](file:///Users/kyananakhmedzade/Desktop/personal_website/_site)

**4. Navigation Email** - Open http://127.0.0.1:4000 and look at the "Mail Me" button in the navbar. If it shows `mailto:kyanan.akhmedzade@mail.ru`, Jekyll is working (it pulled this from _config.yml).

**5. Files in _site/** - The _site folder now has project1.html, project2.html, readon.html (not folders) - this confirms the permalink fix worked!

Your site is definitely running on Jekyll. The files are being processed and served at http://127.0.0.1:4000.

Done! The email has been updated to kahmadzada23890@ada.edu.az in _config.yml. Jekyll will automatically regenerate the site, and the "Mail Me" buttons in the navigation will now use the ADA University email.

Made changes.

User: it did not change

GitHub Copilot: Checked background terminal output

Jekyll doesn't auto-regenerate when _config.yml changes - you need to restart the server. Let me restart it: 

Ran terminal command: lsof -ti:4000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

Ran terminal command: bundle exec jekyll serve

Server restarted with the new email configuration. Now refresh http://127.0.0.1:4000 and the email will be kahmadzada23890@ada.edu.az in the navigation buttons.

GitHub Copilot: Yes! Just go to http://127.0.0.1:4000 in your browser. You should see the Contact link in the navigation menu next to Home, About, and Projects. Click it and it will scroll down to the contact form section.

User: it does not open

GitHub Copilot: Checked background terminal output

The server is running but showing connection reset errors. These are usually harmless. Try these steps:

1. **Clear browser cache** and try again: http://127.0.0.1:4000
2. **Try a different browser** or incognito/private mode
3. **Check if port 4000 is accessible**: 

Ran terminal command: curl -I http://127.0.0.1:4000

The server isn't responding. Let me restart it: 

Ran terminal command: lsof -ti:4000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

Ran terminal command: bundle exec jekyll serve --host 127.0.0.1

Ran terminal command: curl -I http://127.0.0.1:4000

Checked background terminal output

The curl command killed the server. Let me start it again and test properly: 

Ran terminal command: bundle exec jekyll serve

Server is now running. Try opening http://127.0.0.1:4000 in your browser. The Contact link should be in the navigation menu.

User: it goes to projecvt not to contacts

GitHub Copilot: Searched for text `section class="contact` (`**/index.html`), 1 result

The contact section has `id="section_5"` which is correct. The navigation link is already pointing to `#section_5`. Let me check if there's a JavaScript issue or if the sections need different IDs. Let me verify the actual section order: 

Searched for regex `section.*id="section_` (`**/index.html`), 4 results

I see - there's no `section_3`! The sections jump from `section_2` (About) to `section_4` (Projects) to `section_5` (Contact). This might be confusing the click-scroll JavaScript. Let me check if the JavaScript file expects sequential section numbers: 

Read [](file:///Users/kyananakhmedzade/Desktop/personal_website/js/click-scroll.js)

Found it! The JavaScript expects sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in order, but your index.html is missing section_3. The click-scroll JavaScript uses the array index to match nav items to sections, so when you click the 4th nav item (Contact at index 3), it scrolls to section_4 (Projects) instead of section_5 (Contact).

The fix is to renumber the sections to be sequential: 

Using "Multi-Replace String in Files"


```

```

```

```
Fixed! The sections are now numbered sequentially (1, 2, 3, 4) and the navigation links match. Refresh http://127.0.0.1:4000 and the Contact link will now scroll to the contact form correctly.

Made changes.

User: and also can you nav bar when you scroll dow for instance and you are in the section contact but you need about section

GitHub Copilot: Searched for text `navbar` (`**/css/templatemo-first-portfolio-style.css`), 20 results

User: change This project aims to implement and explain core digital logic gates — NOT, OR, AND, and NAND — using Arduino boards and discrete electronic components.

Overview
Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of modern computing systems. The project, created as a team effort (Team #15), consists of four members and aims to transform abstract Boolean logic into physical, observable behaviors.

Instead of covering every possible gate, we focused on a select group — NOT, OR, AND, and NAND — and thoroughly explored how each gate functions, how inputs influence outputs, and how logical decisions are represented via electrical signals.

Team & Process
Each member contributed to the construction, testing, and explanation of the logic gates. Using Arduino boards, breadboards, LEDs, resistors, and input switches, we demonstrated how various logical conditions produce tangible outcomes.

A central aspect of the project was explaining the behavior of each gate. We provided step-by-step walkthroughs of each gate's operation, delving into truth tables, signal flow, and the real-world significance of digital logic. to this This project focuses on the implementation and explanation of key digital logic gates — NOT, OR, AND, and NAND — using Arduino boards and basic electronic components.
